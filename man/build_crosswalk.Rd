\title{Build a Historical FIPS Crosswalk}
\usage{
build_crosswalk(year_from, year_to, endpoints_only = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{year_from}{The starting year for the crosswalk (e.g., 1970).}

\item{year_to}{The target year for the crosswalk (e.g., 2020).}

\item{endpoints_only}{A logical value. If TRUE, only the single crosswalk for
the specified `year_from` to `year_to` is loaded. If FALSE (the default),
it will load and combine all decadal crosswalks between the start and
target years.}
}
\value{
A single data frame containing the combined crosswalk data with
  harmonized column names ('fips_from', 'fips_to').
}
\description{
This function constructs a comprehensive FIPS code crosswalk by combining
individual crosswalk files from a specified start year to a target year.
It assumes a specific directory structure where the source CSV files are located.
